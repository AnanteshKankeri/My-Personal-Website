# Personal Website

This is my first website project! (after a long break!)🎉  
It’s a simple personal site built to practice **HTML**, **CSS**, and a bit of **JavaScript**.

## Features
- Two images and some intro
- Clean and minimal design
- Responsive layout

## Getting Started
Clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/personal-website.git
cd personal-website
